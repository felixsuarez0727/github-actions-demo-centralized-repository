
# GitHub Workflow

This workflow is used to deploy to a specific environment. It can be invoked by other workflows using the `workflow_call` event, enabling easy reuse across different projects or pipelines.

## Description

This workflow deploys to a specified environment based on the value of the `environment` input parameter. It is designed to be reused and called from other workflows, enabling automated deployments to various environments.

## Input

The workflow expects an input parameter called `environment`, which is required. This parameter should specify the target environment for the deployment.

- **`environment`**: The deployment environment (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `dev`, etc.). This value is used to identify the target environment.

## Output

This workflow returns an output called `result`, which indicates the deployment status.

- **`result`**: The status of the deployment (in this case, it will always be set to `success`).

## Usage

This workflow can be reused in other workflows using the `workflow_call` event. Below is an example of how to invoke this workflow in your repository.

### Example Usage

This is an example of how you can use this workflow in a project. In your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, you can call this workflow as follows:

```yaml
name: Deploy Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: your-org/your-central-repo/.github/workflows/deploy-environment.yml@v1
    with:
      environment: production
```
